# Weather Plugin

This is a weather plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).


## Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/Clock/`.

## Coffee

If you would like to buy me a coffee this is a way to do that. 

```json
{
    "fundingUrl": "https://buymeacoffee.com/mstam30561"
}
```

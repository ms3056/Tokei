# Manual Installation

To manually install the plugin, follow these steps:

1. Copy `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json` to your Obsidian vault's plugin directory: `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/Tokei/`.
2. Optional: Copy `Tokei - compact.css` to your snippet directory.

# Usage

1. After enabling the plugin, you won't see anything initially. To open Tokei, use the "Control/Command + P" shortcut and type "Tokei" and then select the **Tokei: Open** command.
2. Drag the Tokei icon to your preferred location.
3. Customize the settings as needed.
4. If you want to modify the layout and color schemes, take a look at `styles.css` and create your own snippet to change the colors and layout.
5. When adding timezones, press Enter after each name or offset entry.
6. Offsets are in UTC format, such as 0, +1, -5, or +5.5 (equivalent to +5:30).

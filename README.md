## Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/Clock/`.
- Alternatively copy over the `clock - compact.css` to your snippet directory

## Usage
- When you first enable the plugin you won't see anything. Control/Command+p and type clock and select the **CLock Plugin: Open Clock** command
- Drag the icon to wherever you want it
- Change the settings as you see fit
- Take a look at the `styles.css` to tinker with the layout and the color schemes.
- When entering timezones click enter after each name or offset entry
- Offsets are in UTC format - so 0 or +1 or -5 or +5.5 (this is equivalent to +5:30)

## Alternative Style
- Just about every element has a CSS class. Look at style.css to get a look at the classes.
- I have included a snippet to change the styling to be more compact
